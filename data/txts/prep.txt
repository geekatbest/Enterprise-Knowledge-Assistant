Evaluation Metrics	Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE	Silhouette score, Inertia, Davies–Bouldin

clustering (DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models)
{Not convex — solution depends on initialization

May converge to local minima

K needs to be chosen beforehand (elbow method or silhouette score can help)}

backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the loss by updating
